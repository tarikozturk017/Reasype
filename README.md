## Motivation

My motivaton for this project was to be able to find new recipes based my need. As a person who likes cooking, sometimes I have limited ingredients or I want to try specific dish type. In this case, instead of searching online and checking if I have the ingreadients, I wanted to create an application that handles all of the things itself. 

## Features

- Max number of ingredients can be selected
- Search with a keyword
- Diet type, Cousine type, etc. can be filtered
- Exclude certain ingredients
- Certain health labels can applied


## Technologies

- React
- Axios
- JavaScript
- CSS



## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install reasype
  cd reasype
```

## Future Goals

Even though this project can be used how it is supposed to be, it can still be improved. There some bugs that needs to be fixed. Additionally, there are couple of features that I want to add to this project. These include but are not limited to:

- When the recipe generated, instead of generating one single recipe, it will generate a couple of selection that matches the user needs.
- Calories can be selected, however this is total calory. Therefore, single serving calories can be calculated and filtered, too.
- Membership system can be created. Recipe can be manuplated with each member's previous search. 
- UI/UX can be improved
